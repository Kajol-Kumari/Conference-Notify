ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends.\rThe main theme of ADCOM 2020 is the \"Edge Analytics\". Edge Analytics is a future research area where people needs to discuss the issues and challenges. This conferences aims to brings various people from India and abroad working in the area of Edge Analytics as an academician, Indutrialist or practitioner to share their knowledges. This conference will foster future perspectives of Edge Analytics. Moreover, ADCOM 2020 focuses on 5G Systems, those are expected to be fully operational by 2020 through its wide range of applications and services. Most importantly, 5G will serve as the enabling architecture and standard for Internet of Things (IoT) systems, Low Power-Wide Area networks and high-speed cellular systems leading to a variety of wireless applications with needs of few bits per seconds to gigabits per seconds with very low latency. This will also significantly extend geographic coverage with delay-sensitive communications. 5G is expected to utilize and exploit new technologies, techniques and protocols at the different communication layers such as software-defined radio, massive antenna systems, MIMO systems, mmWave, optical communications and performance-energy efficient communications protocols.\rImportants Dates\rPaper Submissions due: \t15/04/2020\rAuthor notification: \t15/07/2020\rCamera-ready paper due: \t25/07/2020\rRegistration deadline: \t30/07/2020\rConference date: \t26-28 August 2020\rSubmission Guidelines\r All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.
